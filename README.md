# The code example I provided focuses on the brand "BMW" as a demonstration. 
# Just replace "BMW" with the brand name you want throughout the code. The rest of the code remains the same for all brands.
# In sentiment analysis and topic modeling, remember to update the filtered car brands for each dataset. For example, if you switch to a different dataset instead of BMW, add "BMW" to the list and remove the appropriate car brands specific to that dataset.
