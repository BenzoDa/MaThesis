# The code example I provided focuses on the brand "BMW" as a demonstration. 
# However, the same code structure applies to other brands. All you need to do is replace "BMW" with the relevant brand name wherever it appears throughout the code. 
# Additionally, in sentiment analysis and topic modelling, the filtered car brands have to be adapted for each individual dataset. For instance, when changing to a different dataset than BMW, "BMW" has to be added to the list while removing the new car brands.
